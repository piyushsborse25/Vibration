## **1. Fundamentals & Core Concepts (Q1–Q5)**

---

**1. What is Elasticsearch and how is it different from a traditional RDBMS?**

- **Answer:**  
    Elasticsearch is a **distributed, REST-based search and analytics engine** built on top of Apache Lucene.
    
    - Stores data as **JSON documents** inside indexes.
        
    - Optimized for **full-text search**, not transaction-heavy workloads.
        
    - Horizontal scalability via shards and replicas.
        
    - Schema is flexible (dynamic mapping).
        
    - Query DSL instead of SQL.
        
- **Pitfall Note:** Elasticsearch is **not** a drop-in replacement for RDBMS. It’s eventually consistent, not ACID-compliant for multi-document transactions.

**2. Explain what an inverted index is and how Elasticsearch uses it.**

- **Answer:**
    
    - An inverted index maps each **term** to the list of **documents** containing it.
        
    - Allows quick lookups for search terms.
        
    - Example:
        
        ```
        Term → Doc IDs
        "apple" → [1, 3, 5]
        "banana" → [2, 4]
        ```
        
    - Elasticsearch builds an inverted index during document indexing for each analyzed text field.
        
- **Pitfall Note:** For `keyword` fields, terms are stored as-is without tokenization.

**3. What’s the difference between full-text search and structured search in Elasticsearch?**

- **Answer:**
    
    - **Full-text search:** Analyzed text, tokenized, relevance scoring. (`match`, `match_phrase`)
        
    - **Structured search:** Exact matches on un-analyzed fields (`term`, `range`)
        
- **Pitfall Note:** Using `term` on an analyzed `text` field will often fail because tokens differ from the original string.

**4. What happens if you store numeric data as text instead of integer?**

- **Answer:**
    
    - Sorting and range queries become lexicographic, not numeric (`"100"` < `"20"`).
        
    - Larger storage & slower performance.
        
- **Pitfall Note:** Elasticsearch will not auto-cast in queries — must use correct type in mapping.

**5. How does Elasticsearch achieve near real-time search?**

- **Answer:**
    
    - New documents are stored in an **in-memory buffer** and written to segment files periodically.
        
    - **Refresh interval** (default 1 second) makes changes searchable after refresh.
        
- **Pitfall Note:** Reducing refresh interval increases search freshness but slows indexing performance.
