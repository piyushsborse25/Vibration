### **1. Thread Creation**

- [[Create a thread by extending Thread]]
    
- [[Create a thread by implementing Runnable]]
    
- [[Create a thread using Callable and Future and get the return value]]

### **2. Thread Lifecycle**

- [[Demonstrate thread states - NEW, RUNNABLE, WAITING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate sleep(), yield(), and join() effects on thread execution]]

### **3. Synchronization**

- [[Code to synchronize a method to avoid race conditions]]
    
- [[Code to synchronize a block of code instead of the whole method]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate deadlock between two threads]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate livelock]]
    
- [[Code to show thread starvation]]

### **4. Inter-thread Communication**

- [[Code using wait() and notify() to implement producer-consumer problem]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate notify() vs notifyAll()]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate ThreadLocal usage.]]

### **5. Concurrency Utilities**

- [[Code using ExecutorService to run multiple threads]]
    
- [[Code using ScheduledExecutorService to run tasks at fixed intervals]]
    
- [[Code using CountDownLatch to wait for multiple threads to complete]]
    
- [[Code using CyclicBarrier to make threads wait for each other]]
    
- [[Code using Semaphore to control access to a shared resource]]
    
- [[Code using BlockingQueue to implement producer-consumer]]
    
- [[Code using ConcurrentHashMap to safely update a map from multiple threads]]
    
- [[Code using AtomicInteger for thread-safe counter increments]]

### **6. Advanced/Tricky**

- Write code to demonstrate **volatile variable** behavior in threads.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **race condition** without synchronization.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **reentrant lock (`ReentrantLock`)** with tryLock().
    
- Write code to demonstrate **deadlock prevention** using lock ordering.
