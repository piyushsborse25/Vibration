### **1. Thread Creation**

- [[Create a thread by extending Thread]]
    
- [[Create a thread by implementing Runnable]]
    
- [[Create a thread using Callable and Future and get the return value]]
    

---

### **2. Thread Lifecycle**

- [[Demonstrate thread states - NEW, RUNNABLE, WAITING, BLOCKED, TERMINATED]]
    
- [[Code to demonstrate sleep(), yield(), and join() effects on thread execution]]
    

---

### **3. Synchronization**

- Write code to **synchronize a method** to avoid race conditions.
    
- Write code to **synchronize a block** of code instead of the whole method.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **deadlock** between two threads.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **livelock**.
    
- Write code to show **thread starvation**.
    

---

### **4. Inter-thread Communication**

- Write code using **wait() and notify()** to implement producer-consumer problem.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **notify() vs notifyAll()**.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **ThreadLocal** usage.
    

---

### **5. Concurrency Utilities**

- Write code using **ExecutorService** to run multiple threads.
    
- Write code using **ScheduledExecutorService** to run tasks at fixed intervals.
    
- Write code using **CountDownLatch** to wait for multiple threads to complete.
    
- Write code using **CyclicBarrier** to make threads wait for each other.
    
- Write code using **Semaphore** to control access to a shared resource.
    
- Write code using **BlockingQueue** to implement producer-consumer.
    
- Write code using **ConcurrentHashMap** to safely update a map from multiple threads.
    
- Write code using **AtomicInteger** for thread-safe counter increments.
    

---

### **6. Advanced/Tricky**

- Write code to demonstrate **volatile variable** behavior in threads.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **race condition** without synchronization.
    
- Write code to demonstrate **reentrant lock (`ReentrantLock`)** with tryLock().
    
- Write code to demonstrate **deadlock prevention** using lock ordering.
