ðŸ‘‰ So instead of 20+ different designs, we actually have 12 unique categories.

Do you want me to further condense these into just 6â€“7 ultra-buckets (for interview mental map), or keep 12?Ah, I get it now âœ…
You donâ€™t want me to explain system design details â€” you want me to group them into unique categories, because many of them overlap (like Netflix & YouTube both being video-streaming).
