- Practice:  
  - Write queries and analyze execution plans.  
  - Implement CRUD operations with MongoDB in a Spring Boot app.  

Topic 2: DevOps (Kubernetes, Docker)  
- Learn:  
  - Kubernetes: Deployments, Pods, and scaling strategies.  
  - Docker: Containerization of Spring Boot applications.  
- Practice:  
  - Deploy a Spring Boot app in Docker containers.  
  - Set up Kubernetes for managing application clusters.  
- Resources: Kubernetes and Docker official documentation.  

Topic 3: Jenkins and CI/CD Pipelines  
- Study:  
  - Basics of Jenkins: Setting up pipelines and integration with Git.  
  - Automating builds and deployments.  
- Practice:  
  - Set up a Jenkins pipeline to build and deploy your Spring Boot app on a Docker container.  

Topic 4: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, and Hazelcast  
- Learn:  
  - Elasticsearch: Indexing, querying, and managing search clusters.  
  - OpenSearch: Advanced query features.  
  - Hazelcast: Distributed caching and in-memory data grids.  
- Practice:  
  - Build a search feature using Elasticsearch in a Spring Boot project.  

Section C: Logging, Testing, Mocking, and Final Preparations  
Topic 1: Logstash, Fluentd, and Log4j  
- Learn:  
  - Logstash: Parsing and forwarding logs.  
  - Fluentd: Log aggregation and filtering.  
  - Log4j: Configuring log levels and custom appenders.  
- Practice:  
  - Set up a logging pipeline for your project with Logstash and Fluentd.  

Topic 2: Testing & Mocking (JUnit, Mockito, PowerMock)  
- Study:  
  - JUnit: Writing unit and integration tests.  
  - Mockito: Mocking dependencies in Spring Boot.  
  - PowerMock: Mocking static methods and private methods.  
- Practice:  
  - Write test cases to achieve 80%+ code coverage in your project.  

Topic 3: Real-World Project Integration  
- Combine your knowledge:  
  - Build a Spring Boot application integrated with MongoDB, Elasticsearch, Docker, and Jenkins pipelines.  
  - Include testing (JUnit), logging (Logstash), and caching (Hazelcast).  

Topic 4: Mock Interviews and Behavioral Prep  
- Technical Interviews:  
  - Simulate coding and system design rounds.  
  - Focus on scalability, performance, and clean coding principles.  
- Behavioral Questions:  
  - Use the STAR method to frame responses to common questions like:  
    - "Tell me about a challenging project."  
    - "How do you handle tight deadlines?"  

Final Notes  
1. Time Allocation: Spend at least 2–3 hours daily on preparation.  
2. Resources:  
   - Coding Platforms: LeetCode, HackerRank.  
   - Spring Framework: Baeldung, official Spring documentation.  
   - DevOps: Kubernetes and Docker tutorials on YouTube.  
   - Mock Interviews: Pramp, Interviewing.io.  
3. Key Metrics: Aim for:
