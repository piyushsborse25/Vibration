List Interface Implementations
1. ArrayList
   - A resizable array implementation of the `List` interface.
2. LinkedList
   - A doubly-linked list implementation of the `List` interface.
3. Vector
   - A growable array of objects, similar to `ArrayList`, but synchronized.
4. Stack
   - A subclass of `Vector` that represents a stack of objects.

Set Interface Implementations
1. HashSet
   - A collection that does not allow duplicate elements and is backed by a hash table.
2. LinkedHashSet
   - A hash set that maintains insertion order.
3. TreeSet
   - A `Set` that stores elements in a sorted order using a red-black tree.

Queue Interface Implementations
1. PriorityQueue
   - A queue where elements are ordered based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
2. LinkedList
   - Implements the `Queue` interface, providing a linked list-based implementation.
3. ArrayDeque
   - A resizable array implementation of the `Deque` interface, allowing fast insertion and removal.

Map Interface Implementations
1. HashMap
   - A map that stores key-value pairs and does not maintain order.
2. LinkedHashMap
   - A hash map that maintains the order of elements based on their insertion order.
3. TreeMap
   - A `Map` that stores keys in a sorted order using a red-black tree.
4. WeakHashMap
   - A map where keys are weakly referenced, allowing them to be garbage-collected when not in use.
5. IdentityHashMap
   - A map that uses reference equality (rather than object equality) for comparing keys.

Special Purpose Collections
1. EnumSet
   - A `Set` designed specifically for use with enum types.
2. EnumMap
   - A map that uses enum constants as keys.
3. CopyOnWriteArrayList
   - A thread-safe version of `ArrayList` that uses copy-on-write semantics.
4. CopyOnWriteArraySet
   - A thread-safe version of `HashSet` that uses copy-on-write semantics.

Other Collection Classes
1. AbstractCollection
   - A base class for creating custom collections.
2. AbstractList
   - A base class for creating custom `List` implementations.
3. AbstractSet
   - A base class for creating custom `Set` implementations.
4. AbstractQueue
   - A base class for creating custom `Queue` implementations.
5. AbstractMap
   - A base class for creating custom `Map` implementations.

Java 8 Additional Collection Utilities
1. Stream
   - A new class introduced in Java 8 to process sequences of elements (such as those in a `Collection`) in a functional style.
2. Optional
   - A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value, used to avoid `NullPointerException` in collections.
3. Collectors
   - A utility class for implementing common reduction operations, such as accumulating elements into collections or summarizing data.
