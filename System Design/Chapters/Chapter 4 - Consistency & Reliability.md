When building distributed systems, one of the hardest challenges is **keeping data consistent across multiple nodes while also ensuring reliability in the face of failures**. Users expect data to always be correct and systems to always be available—but these two goals often conflict with each other. This chapter explores the theoretical foundations (CAP theorem), practical trade-offs (consistency models), reliability patterns (idempotency, quorum reads/writes), and real-world solutions (Saga pattern for distributed transactions, especially in Java microservices).

## 4.1 CAP Theorem (CP vs AP)

The **CAP theorem** (also known as Brewer’s theorem) states that in a distributed data system, you can only guarantee **two out of three** properties at the same time:

- **Consistency (C):** Every read receives the most recent write (all nodes agree on the same state).
    
- **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response, even if some nodes are down.
    
- **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues functioning even if network partitions occur (nodes cannot communicate).
    

Since **partitions are inevitable** in large-scale distributed systems (due to network failures, node crashes, or latency spikes), you must choose between **Consistency (CP)** and **Availability (AP):**

- **CP systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):** Prefer correctness over uptime. Example: Traditional relational databases (Postgres, MySQL with strong replication).
    
- **AP systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance):** Prefer availability over correctness. Example: DynamoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase. These often provide **eventual consistency**.
    

⚡ **Interview Angle:** Expect questions like:

- “Design a payment system—do you prefer CP or AP?” → Payment requires **CP** (consistency critical).
    
- “Design a social media newsfeed—do you prefer CP or AP?” → Newsfeed tolerates eventual consistency, so **AP** is acceptable.

## 4.2 Strong vs Eventual Consistency

Consistency in distributed systems is not binary—it’s a **spectrum of models**.

- **Strong Consistency:** Once a write is acknowledged, all future reads return that write.
    
    - Example: Banking transactions (you shouldn’t see outdated balances).
        
    - Downside: Higher latency due to coordination across replicas.
        
- **Eventual Consistency:** After a write, different nodes may temporarily return stale values, but eventually, all replicas converge to the latest state.
    
    - Example: Amazon shopping cart—if you add an item, it may briefly not appear on another device but eventually syncs.
        
    - Benefit: High availability and low latency.
        
- **Causal Consistency:** If operation A happens before B, then all users see A before B. Example: Messaging apps—reply to a message must not appear before the original message.
    
- **Read-Your-Own-Writes Consistency:** After you write data, your subsequent reads reflect it, even if others may see stale values. Example: User profile updates.
    

⚡ **Interview Angle:** A good interviewer will ask:

- “If you had to build WhatsApp message delivery, what model would you pick?”  
    → **Causal + eventual consistency** is good enough.
    
- “If you’re building an e-wallet?”  
    → Must use **strong consistency**.

## 4.3 Quorum-Based Reads/Writes

Distributed databases like Cassandra and Dynamo use **quorum-based mechanisms** to balance consistency and availability.

- Writes and reads are sent to multiple replicas.
    
- A quorum (majority of nodes) must agree before confirming.
    

For **N replicas**:

- **W = number of nodes that must acknowledge a write**
    
- **R = number of nodes that must respond to a read**
    
- To guarantee strong consistency: `W + R > N`
    

Examples:

- Cassandra with N=3, W=2, R=2 → Strong consistency.
    
- Cassandra with N=3, W=1, R=1 → Eventual consistency but faster.
    

⚡ **Interview Angle:**

- “If N=5, what are trade-offs between W=3, R=2 vs W=1, R=5?”
    
    - First is **balanced strong consistency**, second favors **fast writes but consistent reads**.

## 4.4 Idempotency in APIs

In distributed systems, retries are common because of **network failures, timeouts, or crashes**. Without safeguards, retries may cause duplicate side effects.

- **Idempotent operation:** Multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.
    
    - Example: Setting user status = “Active” (safe to retry).
        
- **Non-idempotent operation:** Repeated requests change state multiple times.
    
    - Example: “Transfer $100 from A to B” → multiple retries = multiple deductions.
        

**How to achieve idempotency?**

1. **Use unique request IDs (deduplication):** Track whether a request with ID has already been processed.
    
2. **Token-based approaches:** For payments, generate unique transaction IDs.
    
3. **Design APIs carefully:** Use PUT instead of POST for resource creation when possible.
    

⚡ **Interview Angle:**

- “How would you ensure retry safety in a payment API?”  
    → Use **idempotency keys** and transaction logs.

## 4.5 Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

In microservices, a **single transaction may span multiple services** (e.g., order, payment, inventory, and shipping). Unlike monolithic databases, there’s no global ACID transaction across services.

The **Saga pattern** solves this using **a sequence of local transactions** with compensating actions if something fails.

### Two Approaches:

1. **Choreography (event-driven):**
    
    - Each service publishes an event after completing its local transaction.
        
    - Other services subscribe and react.
        
    - Example: Order Service → Payment Service → Inventory Service.
        
    - Pros: Simple, decoupled.
        
    - Cons: Hard to manage complex flows.
        
2. **Orchestration (centralized controller):**
    
    - A Saga Orchestrator tells each service what to do.
        
    - Example: Order Orchestrator → calls Payment, then Inventory, then Shipping.
        
    - Pros: Easier debugging.
        
    - Cons: Orchestrator becomes a central dependency.
        

### Real-World Example (Java + Spring Boot + Kafka):

- User places an **order**.
    
- **Order Service** creates an entry and sends an event to Kafka topic `orders`.
    
- **Payment Service** listens, charges the customer, and publishes `payment-completed`.
    
- **Inventory Service** listens, reduces stock, and publishes `inventory-reserved`.
    
- **Shipping Service** listens and dispatches product.
    
- If Payment fails → Payment Service publishes `payment-failed`, and Order Service **triggers compensation** (cancel order).
    

⚡ **Interview Angle:**

- “How do you implement distributed transactions in microservices?”  
    → Answer with **Saga pattern**.
    
- “How do you avoid double payments in retries?”  
    → Answer with **idempotency keys + Saga rollback**.
