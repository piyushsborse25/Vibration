It’s structured so you can **flow naturally**, and I include **detailed talking points, diagrams you can verbalize, likely cross-questions + strong answers**, and **enterprise/production-level architecture** options (microservices, data stores, messaging, monitoring, security, scalability).

Use this as a script: start with the top-level story, drill into design, show examples, then cover edge-cases, operations, and future improvements. I’ll also give a suggested **timing plan** so you can pace yourself for one hour.

---

# Plan & Timing (how to stretch to ~60 minutes)

- 0–5 min — Elevator pitch + problem statement and goals.
    
- 5–20 min — Requirements: functional + non-functional, domain modeling and API design (contract-first).
    
- 20–35 min — Data model & implementation details (DB schema, entities, service layer, settlement algorithm).
    
- 35–50 min — Production concerns: scaling, microservices architecture, async patterns, resilience, ops.
    
- 50–60 min — Q&A prep: cross-questions with answers, future roadmap & advanced improvements.
    

You can pause between sections to ask “Would you like me to dive deeper?” — that helps gauge interviewer interest and naturally expand time.

# 0. Elevator Pitch (say this first — 1–2 minutes)

“Payshare is an event-centric expense-sharing service. The core idea: a user creates an **Event** (a trip, dinner, party) and either creates or reuses a **Group** (a set of people). Users create **Expenses** inside Events; each expense can list exact per-person shares (no forced equal splits) and who paid. The system computes net balances, produces simplified settlements, and exposes REST endpoints and services to support mobile/web clients. I built the design contract-first, focusing on a consumer-friendly set of APIs and a robust, production-ready back-end architecture that supports scale, security, and operational visibility.”

---

# 1. Requirement Understanding (5–7 minutes)

## Functional requirements (speak slowly and enumerate)

- Create/read/update/delete Users, Groups, Events, Expenses.
    
- Reuse or create Group during Event creation.
    
- Expenses can have **explicit per-person amounts** (not only percentage/equal).
    
- Support expense splits that map _payer → multiple payees with amounts_.
    
- Compute per-user net balances for an Event and produce **simplified settlement** transactions.
    
- Provide endpoints for per-user balances and for global settlement suggestions.
    
- Audit history for all changes (who added/edited expense, timestamp).
    
- Support multi-currency and currency conversion (optional/advanced).
    

## Non-functional requirements

- Performance: low latency reads for event/expense pages (mobile UX).
    
- Scalability: handle many concurrent events and users (multi-tenant).
    
- Consistency: financial data must be correct; prefer strong consistency for writes where appropriate.
    
- Security & privacy: authentication, authorization, PII protection, audit logs.
    
- Observability & SLA: logging, metrics, alerts, incident recovery.
    

---

# 2. Design Philosophy & High-level Decisions (5–8 minutes)

## Contract-first API design

- I design APIs first (OpenAPI/Swagger). This makes frontends independent and stable.
    
- Example endpoints (base `payshare-service/v1`):
    
    - `POST /user`, `GET /user/{id}`...
        
    - `POST /group`, `GET /group/{id}`, `PUT /group/{id}/participants`
        
    - `POST /event` (accept `groupId` or embedded `group`), `GET /event/{id}`
        
    - `POST /event/{id}/expense`, `GET /event/{id}/expense`
        
    - `GET /event/{id}/balances`, `GET /event/{id}/settle`, `GET /event/{id}/settle/{userId}`
        

## Read vs Write models

- Write APIs are minimal (only necessary fields).
    
- Read APIs are _rich_ (denormalized responses that embed group, participants, expenses) to minimize round trips.
    

## Event-centric model with reusable Groups (explain rationale)

- Groups are standalone (can be reused across events) but also act as a sub-entity of Event.
    
- This supports typical UX: “use my travel group” vs “create a one-off group for this event.”
    

---

# 3. Domain Modeling & Data Schema (15 minutes — speak deeply)

Explain verbally and, if there’s a whiteboard, sketch tables and relationships.

## Key entities

- `User` (id, name, email, phone, createdAt)
    
- `Group` (id, name, adminUserId, createdAt)
    
- `group_members` (group_id, user_id, role)
    
- `Event` (id, name, group_id or group_snapshot, createdAt, createdBy)
    
- `Expense` (id, event_id, name, description, amount, currency, paidByUserId, createdAt, status)
    
- `ExpenseSplit` (id, expense_id, payee_user_id, shareAmount)
    
- `Settlement` (computed, not necessarily persisted except for executed transactions)
    
- `AuditLog` (entity, entity_id, operation, actor, timestamp, diff)
    

## Two strategies for Event↔Group

- **Reference model**: Event has `groupId` reference. Easy to reuse but the group can change over time (members added/removed) — need to decide snapshot vs live-members semantics.
    
- **Snapshot model**: store `group_snapshot` embedded (participants list) at event creation; ensures event members are fixed. This avoids surprises if someone leaves the group later. I typically store both: `groupId` for reuse, and `group_snapshot` to capture event-level membership at creation.
    

## ExpenseSplit model rationale

- Keep `Expense.paidBy` as payer.
    
- `ExpenseSplit` lists `payee` and `shareAmount`. Each split indicates how much that payee owes for that expense.
    
- This design supports arbitrary splits (per-user amounts), unequal shares, and when an expense is for a subset of participants.
    

---

# 4. Core Algorithms & Implementation Details (15 minutes)

## Balance computation (describe step-by-step)

1. For an `Event`, iterate expenses:
    
    - For each `expense`: `payer = paidBy`, for each `split`:
        
        - Increase `payer`’s credit by `shareAmount` (or increase payer’s “paid” by entire expense and reduce each payee’s owed by shareAmount).
            
        - Increase `payee`’s owed by `shareAmount`.
            
2. For each user: `net = paid_amount - owed_amount`.
    
3. Produce list of users with positive net (creditors) and negative net (debtors).
    

## Debt simplification algorithm (minimum cash flow — greedy)

- Maintain two lists: creditors sorted descending, debtors sorted ascending.
    
- Greedily match the largest creditor with the largest debtor, settle min(amount_owed, amount_due), subtract and continue.
    
- Complexity O(n log n) for sorting and O(n) for transactions.
    
- This minimizes number of transactions in practice (not guaranteed minimal count in graph-theoretic sense for all cost functions but widely accepted).
    

**Edge cases**:

- Tiny rounding differences (currency cents) — handle rounding by keeping integers (cents) and implement a deterministic tie-breaker to distribute rounding residuals.
    
- Negative/zero splits — validate in API.
    

## Concurrency & consistency

- Use DB transactions on expense creation & split inserts. Validate event membership inside same transaction.
    
- For high contention (editing same expense), use optimistic locking (versioning) on Expense rows to prevent lost updates.
    
- For balance computation, read-only; but if you maintain precomputed running balances in DB (for performance), ensure updates are transactional or use an event-sourced counter.

# 5. API Examples & Request/Response (briefly show samples — 3–4 min)

Give two concrete examples you can recite.

**POST /event**  
Request (creation with new group):

```json
{
  "name": "Goa Trip",
  "group": { "name": "Friends", "participants": [ {"userId": 1}, {"userId": 2} ] },
  "createdBy": 1
}
```

Request (creation reusing existing group):

```json
{
  "name": "Goa Trip",
  "groupId": 10,
  "createdBy": 1
}
```

**POST /event/{id}/expense**

```json
{
  "name": "Dinner",
  "amount": 2400,
  "paidBy": 1,
  "expenseSplit": [
    {"payeeId":1,"shareAmount":800},
    {"payeeId":2,"shareAmount":800},
    {"payeeId":3,"shareAmount":800}
  ]
}
```

**GET /event/{id}/balances** — returns per-user net balances.  
**GET /event/{id}/settle** — returns simplified transactions (list of `{from,to,amount}`).

---

# 6. Production/Enterprise Architecture (microservices & system design) — 15+ minutes

Start with a single-service monolith → explain path to microservices.

## When monolith is fine

- Small team; faster iteration; bounded scale.
    
- Architect as modular codebase (clear layers) to enable later decomposition.
    

## Microservices decomposition (if required)

Possible services:

- **User Service** — user CRUD, auth info (or delegated to Auth service).
    
- **Group Service** — group CRUD, members.
    
- **Event Service** — event lifecycle, group snapshots.
    
- **Expense Service** — expense CRUD, splits, validation.
    
- **Settlement Service** — computing balances & settlement suggestions (can be read-heavy and CPU-bound).
    
- **Notification Service** — email/push/SMS for invites and settle reminders.
    
- **Billing/Payments Service** (optional) — if enabling actual money transfers.
    
- **Audit & Logging Service** — consolidated logs and audit events.
    
- **Auth/Identity Service** — OAuth/JWT, RBAC.
    

### Communication

- Internal synchronous REST/gRPC for simple queries.
    
- **Event-driven** (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for async flows:
    
    - `expense.created` → triggers recompute of event balances (async) and update of cached aggregates.
        
    - `expense.updated`/`expense.deleted` → triggers reconciliation.
        
    - `settlement.executed` → triggers notifications and ledger entry.
        

### Read model & CQRS

- Use **CQRS** for heavy read operations (balances, history).
    
    - Write side updates canonical models and publishes events.
        
    - Read side projects data into optimized read stores (denormalized JSON documents) for quick responses (e.g., EventBalance store).
        
- This decouples computation-heavy balance processing from writes.
    

### Data stores

- **Primary DB**: relational (Postgres / MySQL) for strong consistency of financial transactions.
    
- **Read replicas / Materialized views**: for read scaling.
    
- **Document store** (MongoDB or Elastic) for denormalized event responses.
    
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event streams.
    
- **Cache**: Redis for hot reads (event pages) and rate limiting.
    

### Transactions across services

- Financial operations that span services require careful handling:
    
    - Use **sagas** (choreography or orchestration) for multi-step distributed transactions (e.g., when integrating with payment gateway).
        
    - Idempotency keys + compensating actions for failures.
        

### Scalability & performance patterns

- Use pagination, streaming for large expense lists.
    
- Cache event read responses with eviction on change (cache invalidation from event bus).
    
- Precompute balances asynchronously and store in read store for instant GETs; recompute on changes.
    

---

# 7. Reliability, Observability & Security (10 minutes)

## Observability

- **Logging**: structured, correlate via `requestId`. Use ELK/EFK stack.
    
- **Metrics**: Prometheus metrics for request latency, error rates, balance computation time.
    
- **Tracing**: Distributed tracing (Jaeger/Zipkin) across microservices.
    
- **Alerts & SLOs**: error rate < X%, p95 latency < Y ms. PagerDuty for on-call.
    

## Testing strategy

- Unit tests + coverage for business logic.
    
- Integration tests (Testcontainers) for DB dependencies.
    
- Contract tests for services (Pact).
    
- End-to-end test pipeline in CI.
    

## Security

- Auth: OAuth2 / JWT tokens; refresh tokens with rotating keys.
    
- RBAC: admin group operations vs normal members.
    
- Input validation & schema checks (prevent negative amounts, invalid user IDs).
    
- Rate limiting on public endpoints.
    
- Data protection: PII encryption at rest (DB) or field-level encryption.
    
- Audit logs immutable (append-only) with retention policies.
    

## Compliance & Privacy

- GDPR: Right to be forgotten — approach: soft-delete vs anonymization; careful with financial records (may need retention).
    
- Sensitive data masking in logs.

# 8. Operational Concerns & Edge Cases (10 minutes)

## Edge Cases & How to answer them (speak as Q&A)

- **Q: What if I edit an expense after settlement suggestions?**
    
    - A: We mark settlement suggestions as ephemeral; when expense changes, recompute settlements. If payments were executed, require reconciliation step and possibly reverse/compensate.
        
- **Q: What about currencies?**
    
    - A: Each expense has currency. Convert to event base currency using exchange rates at expense time. Record exchange rates and converted amounts in DB to ensure deterministic computations.
        
- **Q: How to handle split rounding?**
    
    - A: Work in smallest currency unit (cents). For distribution leftover, define deterministic rule (assign remainder to payer or earliest payee).
        
- **Q: What if a user is removed from a group after event creation?**
    
    - A: Use group snapshot at event creation. Removal from group does not retroactively change event membership unless explicitly requested (and audit + consent required).
        
- **Q: How to prevent duplicate expense postings from retry?**
    
    - A: Use idempotency keys on expense creation and check for existing idempotency key in DB.
        
- **Q: How to handle offline mobile clients?**
    
    - A: Support local queuing + idempotent POSTs with idempotency keys; server validates duplicates.
        
- **Q: What if the number of participants is huge (1000+) for an event?**
    
    - A: Balance computation is O(E * P) where E=expenses, P=participants per expense; handle with batching and incremental updates; compute in background and cache results.
        
- **Q: Handling malicious/fraudulent edits?**
    
    - A: Audit trails + role validation; admin approval for major edits; alerts for suspicious changes.

# 9. Data Integrity & Auditing (4 minutes)

- Every financial operation is logged in `AuditLog`.
    
- Versioned entities (optimistic lock) to detect concurrent edits.
    
- Immutable append-only ledger for executed settlement transactions (if actual payments involved).
    
- Periodic reconciliation jobs comparing read-model balances vs write-model transactions to detect drift.
    

---

# 10. Future Enhancements & Roadmap (5–8 minutes)

List of features to add for improved production readiness and differentiation:

## Short-term

- Multi-currency and currency management.
    
- Email/push notifications + reminders for unsettled balances.
    
- UI-friendly read endpoints: monthly summaries, expense trends.
    
- Mobile offline support & conflict resolution strategies.
    

## Medium-term

- Real-time collaborative editing (WebSocket) for shared expense entry.
    
- Integrate payment gateways (Stripe/UPI) for direct settlements — requires escrow & compliance.
    
- Analytics: average spend per user, event-level breakdowns, anomaly detection (sudden large expense).
    
- Export capabilities (CSV, Excel).
    

## Long-term / Enterprise-level

- Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise customers (teams). Tenant isolation at DB or schema level.
    
- SSO integration (SAML/OAuth2) with enterprises.
    
- Data warehousing for BI and OLAP.
    
- Advanced settlement optimization: minimize cross-bank transfers, account-aware routing.

# 11. Example Deep Cross-Questions + Model Answers (useful for interview; take your time)

I’ll list common interviewer probes and concise, strong responses you can expand on.

**Q: Why did you choose Event as the primary entity?**  
A: Because UX revolves around occasions (trip/dinner). Events group expenses and snapshots membership; it simplifies the API surface for consumers. Groups are reusable but semantically “inside events”.

**Q: Why not keep Group strictly nested in Event?**  
A: Groups are real-world reusable constructs — users want persistent friend-groups. Reuse reduces repeated invites and aligns with product expectations. But we snapshot membership in events to preserve history.

**Q: Why relational DB vs NoSQL?**  
A: Financial correctness and ACID are critical — relational DBs (Postgres) are a better default. We can complement with NoSQL read stores for denormalized event responses.

**Q: How to reduce response latency for large events?**  
A: Precompute balances asynchronously, cache read results in Redis, denormalize event responses into a document DB.

**Q: If you scale to millions of events, what problems arise?**  
A: DB hotspots on frequently accessed events, high cardinality read traffic. Solutions: read replicas, sharding, caching, and partitioning by tenant/event id ranges.

**Q: How to minimize number of settlement transactions further (beyond greedy)?**  
A: The greedy algorithm is simple and effective. For minimal transaction count in graph-theory sense, use exact algorithms (NP-hard in some formulations) or heuristics like cycle cancellation and graph compression. But complexity tradeoffs exist; we choose practical heuristics.

**Q: If two users have parallel simultaneous edits on expense splits, how do you handle it?**  
A: Use optimistic locking with version numbers; on conflict return 409 with latest state; client merges or replays intended change. For collaborative scenarios, offer locking or CRDT-based merging for UX.

**Q: Why event-driven architecture?**  
A: It decouples services, enables async recomputation (heavy tasks off the critical path), supports replayability and auditability. Kafka provides durable logs for reconciliation.

# 12. Closing pitch (1–2 minutes)

“I focused on building a system that’s correct first (financial integrity), then usable (rich response models and simple APIs), and finally scalable and operable (microservices, event-driven flows, observability). The architecture allows a single monolith to iterate quickly and a clear pathway to microservices as user scale needs grow. My design balances practical engineering trade-offs — consistency, latency, cost — while supporting future features like payments, enterprise multi-tenancy, and advanced settlement optimizations.”

---

# Quick reference cheat-sheet (say this at the end — 2 minutes)

- Entity diagram to verbally describe: `User ↔ Group ↔ Event ↔ Expense ↔ ExpenseSplit`.
    
- Key endpoints: `POST /event`, `POST /event/{id}/expense`, `GET /event/{id}/balances`, `GET /event/{id}/settle`.
    
- Settlement algorithm: compute net balances → greedy match creditors/debtors.
    
- Production stack: Postgres + Kafka + Redis + Elastic + Kubernetes + Prometheus + Jaeger.
    
- Safety: audit logs, optimistic locking, idempotency keys, encryption.

# How to use this script

- Memorize the elevator pitch and the 4–5 core bullets (requirements, domain entities, API-first, settlement algorithm, enterprise concerns).
    
- Use the “Deep Cross-Questions” section to practice answers — interviewers will probe these.
    
- Keep examples ready (small event JSONs or numbers) to show you can run through a sample balance & settlement calculation live.
    
- If asked to whiteboard, sketch the entity relationships, the event flow (API call → DB write → event publish → recompute → read store update), and the microservices decomposition.
