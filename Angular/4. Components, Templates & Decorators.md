## **1. What is a component in Angular?**  
A component in Angular is the fundamental building block of an application. It defines the structure, behavior, and styles of a **UI element** in the application. Each component consists of three main parts:  
- **Template**: Defines the view (HTML).  
- **Class**: Contains logic and data (TypeScript).  
- **Styles**: Defines the appearance (CSS).

## **2. How do you define a component in Angular?**  
A component is defined by using the `@Component` decorator, which specifies the metadata required for the component. A basic component definition looks like this:  
```ts
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-component',
  templateUrl: './my-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-component.component.css']
})
export class MyComponent {
  // Component logic goes here
}
```
- **selector**: Defines the HTML tag to use the 4. Components, Templates & Decorators.
- **selector**: Defines the HTML tag to use the 4. Components, Templates & Decorators.
- **templateUrl**: Points to the HTML template.
- **styleUrls**: Points to the CSS files for styling.

## **3. What are component metadata properties?**  
Component metadata properties are defined using the `@Component` decorator, providing information about how Angular should process the component. Common properties include:  
- **selector**: Specifies the HTML tag to represent the component.  
- **templateUrl** / **template**: Points to or contains the HTML view for the component.  
- **styleUrls** / **styles**: Specifies the styles associated with the component.  
- **providers**: Defines services that will be available to the component.  
- **animations**: Specifies animations associated with the component.

## **4. What is a template in Angular?**  
A template in Angular is an HTML view associated with a component. It contains Angular-specific syntax to bind data, handle events, and display dynamic content. Templates can include:  
- **Bindings** (e.g., `{{ expression }}`, `[property]="value"`, etc.).  
- **Directives** (e.g., `ngIf`, `ngFor`).  
- **Event handlers** (e.g., `(click)="action()"`).

---

## **5. How do you bind HTML elements inside a template?**  
Binding in Angular is done using three types of binding:  
- **Interpolation (`{{ }}`)**: Used to bind expressions to HTML properties.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  ```
- **Property binding (`[property]`)**: Binds an HTML element's property to a component property.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <img [src]="imageUrl" />
  ```
- **Event binding (`(event)`)**: Binds a DOM event to a method.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
  ```

---

## **6. What is a template reference variable?**  
A **template reference variable** is a reference to an HTML element or component in the template. It is defined with the `#` symbol.  
Example:  
```html
<input #inputElement type="text" />
<button (click)="log(inputElement.value)">Log Value</button>
```
The `#inputElement` variable gives access to the `input` element in the template.

## **7. What are decorators in Angular?**  
Decorators are special functions in Angular that add metadata to classes, properties, methods, and parameters. They provide configuration information to Angular to define how an element should behave.  
The common decorators in Angular include:  
- **@Component**: Defines a component.  
- **@Injectable**: Marks a class as injectable into other classes.  
- **@NgModule**: Defines an Angular module.  
- **@Input** and **@Output**: Marks properties for data binding.

---

## **8. What are different types of decorators in Angular?**  
Angular has several decorators to define various features:  
- **@Component**: Declares a component.  
- **@NgModule**: Declares a module, which is a container for components and services.  
- **@Injectable**: Marks a service class that can be injected into other services or components.  
- **@Input**: Marks a property as an input to receive data from a parent component.  
- **@Output**: Marks a property to emit events from a child component to a parent.

## **9. How do component styles work in Angular?**  
Component styles in Angular are scoped to the component, meaning they are **encapsulated** and don’t affect other components. Styles are defined in the `styleUrls` or `styles` metadata of the component. You can also use **ViewEncapsulation** to control how styles are encapsulated.  
Angular supports global, component, and shadow DOM styles.

---

## **10. What is a nested component?**  
A **nested component** is a component that is used within another component’s template. The parent component uses the child component’s selector to include it.  
Example:  
```html
<!-- parent.component.html -->
<app-child></app-child>
```
In this case, `app-child` is a nested component.

---

## **11. How do you pass data between components?**  
Data can be passed between components using **Input** and **Output** properties.  
- **Input**: Allows a parent component to pass data to a child component.  
  Example:  
  ```ts
  @Input() data: string;
  ```
- **Output**: Allows a child component to send data to a parent component via events.  
  Example:  
  ```ts
  @Output() dataEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();
  ```

---

## **12. What is an input property in Angular?**  
An **input property** is a property in a child component that receives data from a parent component. It is defined using the `@Input` decorator.  
Example:  
```ts
@Input() parentData: string;
```
The parent component binds data to the child:  
```html
<app-child [parentData]="data"></app-child>
```

---

## **13. What is an output property in Angular?**  
An **output property** is a property in a child component that emits events to the parent component. It is defined using the `@Output` decorator and `EventEmitter`.  
Example:  
```ts
@Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();
```
The parent listens to the event:  
```html
<app-child (notify)="onNotify($event)"></app-child>
```

---

## **14. What is interpolation in Angular?**  
**Interpolation** in Angular is the process of binding a component's data to the HTML view using the `{{ expression }}` syntax. It’s used to display data or evaluate expressions within templates.  
Example:  
```html
<p>{{ user.name }}</p>
```

---

## **15. How do you create dynamic components in Angular?**  
Dynamic components are created at runtime using **`ComponentFactoryResolver`** and **`ViewContainerRef`**.  
Example:  
1. Create a container in the template:  
   ```html
   <ng-template #dynamicComponentContainer></ng-template>
   ```
2. In the component, dynamically create a component:  
   ```ts
   import { ComponentFactoryResolver, ViewChild, ViewContainerRef } from '@angular/core';

   @ViewChild('dynamicComponentContainer', { read: ViewContainerRef, static: false }) container: ViewContainerRef;

   constructor(private resolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) { }

   createDynamicComponent() {
     const factory = this.resolver.resolveComponentFactory(DynamicComponent);
     this.container.createComponent(factory);
   }
   ```

## **16. How do Angular directives work inside templates?**  
Angular directives are used to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model). They can modify elements, attributes, or add behavior. Directives are classified into three types:  
- **Structural Directives**: Modify the layout by adding or removing elements (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).  
- **Attribute Directives**: Modify the appearance or behavior of an element (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`).  
- **Component Directives**: Encapsulate functionality as a component (every Angular component is a directive).

---

## **17. What is ViewEncapsulation in Angular?**  
**ViewEncapsulation** determines how the styles of a component are scoped. There are three types:  
- **Emulated (default)**: Styles are scoped to the component using Shadow DOM-like emulation.  
- **Native**: Styles are scoped using the native Shadow DOM.  
- **None**: Styles are not scoped, and they affect global styles.

---

## **18. What is content projection in Angular?**  
Content projection allows a parent component to **inject content** into a child component’s template using `<ng-content></ng-content>`. It is often used to create reusable components like modals or cards.  
Example:  
```html
<app-card>
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Content</p>
</app-card>
```
In `app-card`, content is projected where `<ng-content>` is placed.

## **19. What is change detection, and how does it work in components?**  
**Change detection** in Angular tracks changes to data-bound properties and updates the view accordingly. Angular checks the components and updates them when their model changes.  
- **Default Change Detection Strategy**: Angular checks every component in the app.  
- **OnPush Change Detection Strategy**: Angular checks the component only if its inputs change or if events occur in the component.

---

## **20. How do you destroy a component in Angular?**  
A component is destroyed when it is removed from the DOM, usually when the component’s parent removes it. You can also manually destroy a component by calling the `ngOnDestroy()` lifecycle hook.  
```ts
ngOnDestroy() {
  // Cleanup logic
}
```

### **Conclusion**  
Components, templates, and decorators are key to building Angular applications. They provide structure, manage data flow, and allow reusable, dynamic UI elements with clean and maintainable code.
