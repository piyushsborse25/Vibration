## **1. What is data binding in Angular?**  
**Data binding** in Angular is a mechanism that allows synchronization of data between the component and the view (UI). It enables Angular to automatically update the view whenever the component's data changes and vice versa. Data binding can be used to pass data, trigger events, and manage DOM interactions seamlessly.

## **2. What are the four types of data binding?**  
The four main types of data binding in Angular are:
- **Interpolation (`{{ }}`)**: Binds data from the component to the view as text.
  Example:  
  ```html
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  ```
- **Property Binding (`[property]`)**: Binds the component’s property to an element's property.
  Example:  
  ```html
  <img [src]="imageUrl" />
  ```
- **Event Binding (`(event)`)**: Binds a DOM event to a method in the component.
  Example:  
  ```html
  <button (click)="onClick()">Click me</button>
  ```
- **Two-Way Binding (`[(ngModel)]`)**: Allows two-way data binding, automatically updating both the view and the component's property.
  Example:  
  ```html
  <input [(ngModel)]="name" />
  ```

---

## **3. What is property binding in Angular?**  
**Property binding** is used to bind a component's property to an HTML element's property. It allows you to dynamically set the properties of DOM elements, such as `src`, `href`, `disabled`, etc.  
Example:  
```html
<img [src]="imageUrl" />
```
Here, the `src` property of the `img` tag is bound to the `imageUrl` property in the component.

---

## **4. What is event binding in Angular?**  
**Event binding** allows the binding of DOM events like `click`, `mouseover`, or `keyup` to methods in the component class. It enables user interactions with the UI.  
Example:  
```html
<button (click)="handleClick()">Click Me</button>
```
This binds the `click` event to the `handleClick()` method in the component.

---

## **5. What is two-way data binding in Angular?**  
**Two-way data binding** allows for synchronization of data between the component and the view. Changes in the UI are reflected in the component and vice versa. Angular uses `ngModel` for two-way binding.  
Example:  
```html
<input [(ngModel)]="userName" />
```
Any changes in the input field will update the `userName` property in the component, and vice versa.

---

## **6. What are Angular directives?**  
**Directives** in Angular are special markers that extend the HTML capabilities by adding behavior to elements in the DOM. They can manipulate the DOM, change the appearance, or add event listeners. There are three main types of directives:  
- **Structural Directives**: Modify the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements (e.g., `ngIf`, `ngFor`).  
- **Attribute Directives**: Change the appearance or behavior of DOM elements (e.g., `ngClass`, `ngStyle`).  
- **Component Directives**: Encapsulate UI elements and their behavior (every Angular component is a directive).

---

## **7. What is the difference between structural and attribute directives?**  
- **Structural Directives**: These directives change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements. They are prefixed with an asterisk (`*`), e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`.
- **Attribute Directives**: These directives change the appearance or behavior of existing DOM elements without affecting the structure. Examples include `ngClass`, `ngStyle`, and `ngModel`.

---

## **8. What are built-in directives in Angular?**  
Angular provides several built-in directives:
- **`ngIf`**: Conditionally includes or excludes elements from the DOM.  
- **`ngFor`**: Loops through a collection and renders an element for each item.  
- **`ngSwitch`**: Switches between different templates based on a condition.  
- **`ngClass`**: Dynamically adds or removes CSS classes to/from an element.  
- **`ngStyle`**: Dynamically applies inline styles to an element.  
- **`ngModel`**: Binds input elements to component properties, facilitating two-way data binding.

---

## **9. What is ngIf, and how does it work?**  
**`ngIf`** is a structural directive that conditionally adds or removes elements from the DOM based on a Boolean expression. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the element is included; otherwise, it is removed.  
Example:  
```html
<div *ngIf="isVisible">This content is visible</div>
```
If `isVisible` is `true`, the content will be rendered; otherwise, it will not appear.

---

## **10. What is ngFor, and how does it work?**  
**`ngFor`** is a structural directive used to iterate over an array or list and render a template for each item in the collection.  
Example:  
```html
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```
Here, `ngFor` iterates over the `items` array, rendering each item in an `<li>` element.

---

## **11. What is ngSwitch, and how does it work?**  
**`ngSwitch`** is a structural directive that allows switching between different templates based on a specific condition. It is used in conjunction with `ngSwitchCase` and `ngSwitchDefault`.  
Example:  
```html
<div [ngSwitch]="value">
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'A'">Case A</div>
  <div *ngSwitchCase="'B'">Case B</div>
  <div *ngSwitchDefault>Default case</div>
</div>
```
Here, the content inside the respective `ngSwitchCase` will be rendered based on the value of `value`.

## **12. What are custom directives in Angular?**  
**Custom directives** are user-defined directives that allow you to create reusable behavior for DOM elements. You can create custom attribute or structural directives to extend Angular's functionality.

---

## **13. How do you create a custom directive in Angular?**  
To create a custom directive, use the `@Directive` decorator, which defines the behavior of the directive.  
Example:  
```ts
import { Directive, ElementRef, Renderer2 } from '@angular/core';

@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef, private renderer: Renderer2) {
    this.renderer.setStyle(this.el.nativeElement, 'backgroundColor', 'yellow');
  }
}
```
In this example, the `HighlightDirective` changes the background color of an element to yellow when the directive is applied.

---

## **14. What is @Input in Angular?**  
**`@Input`** is a decorator that allows data to be passed from a parent component to a child component. It is used to bind the value of a property in the parent to a property in the child.  
Example:  
```ts
@Input() parentData: string;
```
In the parent component, you bind the data:  
```html
<app-child [parentData]="data"></app-child>
```

---

## **15. What is @Output in Angular?**  
**`@Output`** is a decorator used to send data from a child component to a parent component. It emits events that the parent can listen to.  
Example:  
```ts
@Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();
```
In the parent component:  
```html
<app-child (notify)="onNotify($event)"></app-child>
```

---

## **16. What is an event emitter in Angular?**  
An **`EventEmitter`** is a class in Angular used to emit custom events in the child component, which can be subscribed to by the parent component. It works in conjunction with `@Output` to send data.  
Example:  
```ts
export class ChildComponent {
  @Output() notify = new EventEmitter<string>();

  sendNotification() {
    this.notify.emit('Message from child');
  }
}
```

---

## **17. How does Angular handle DOM updates?**  
Angular uses a **change detection mechanism** to detect changes in the data model and update the DOM accordingly. It checks the component’s model and updates the view if the model has changed. Angular can use different strategies, such as the **default** or **OnPush** strategy, for efficient DOM updates.

---

## **18. What is dynamic data binding in Angular?**  
**Dynamic data binding** refers to the ability to bind data to DOM elements dynamically, meaning the view is automatically updated whenever the component’s data changes. This is a core feature of Angular’s two-way data binding system.

---

## **19. What is the difference between ngClass and ngStyle?**  
- **`ngClass`**: Used to dynamically add or remove CSS classes based on conditions.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <div [ngClass]="{ 'active': isActive }"></div>
  ```
- **`ngStyle`**: Used to dynamically set inline styles on elements based on conditions.  
  Example:  
  ```html
  <div [ngStyle]="{ 'color': color }"></div>
  ```

---

## **20. What is content projection in Angular?**  
**Content projection** is a pattern in Angular that allows the parent component to inject content into a child component. This is achieved through `<ng-content>` tags in the child component's template, allowing dynamic content to be rendered within the child component's view.
