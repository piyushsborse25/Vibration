## **1. What is Angular CLI, and why is it used?**  
Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a **powerful tool** that simplifies Angular development by automating project setup, configuration, and builds. It is used to:  
- **Create and manage Angular projects** easily.  
- **Generate components, services, and modules** quickly.  
- **Build and optimize applications** for production.  
- **Run development servers** with live reloading.  
- **Perform testing** with built-in unit and end-to-end testing tools.

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
To verify the installation, run:  
```sh
ng version
```

## **5. How do you serve an Angular application using CLI?**  
To serve the application locally, run:  
```sh
ng serve
```
Options:  
- `--open` → Opens in a browser.  
- `--port 4201` → Runs on a specific port.

---

## **6. What is the purpose of `ng generate` commands?**  
The `ng generate` command is used to **automate code creation**, ensuring best practices and consistency.  
Example:  
```sh
ng generate component my-component
ng generate service my-service
ng generate module my-module
```
Aliases:  
- `ng g c` → Generate component  
- `ng g s` → Generate service  
- `ng g m` → Generate module  

---

## **7. How do you create a new component using Angular CLI?**  
Run:  
```sh
ng generate component my-component
```
This creates:  
```
src/app/
  my-component/
    my-component.component.ts
    my-component.component.html
    my-component.component.css
    my-component.component.spec.ts
```
To use the component, add it to a module:  
```ts
@NgModule({
  declarations: [MyComponent]
})
```

---

## **8. How do you add a module using Angular CLI?**  
Run:  
```sh
ng generate module my-module
```
This creates:  
```
src/app/
  my-module/
    my-module.module.ts
```

To import into `app.module.ts`:  
```ts
import { MyModule } from './my-module/my-module.module';
```

---

## **9. What is `ng build`, and what does it do?**  
The `ng build` command **compiles** the application and generates the `dist/` folder for deployment.  
```sh
ng build --configuration=production
```
It optimizes the output by:  
- **Minifying and uglifying** the code.  
- **Removing unnecessary parts** (Tree Shaking).  
- **Using Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation**.  

---

## **10. How does Angular optimize the production build?**  
- **AOT Compilation**: Compiles templates at build time.  
- **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code.  
- **Minification & Uglification**: Reduces file size.  
- **Lazy Loading**: Loads modules on demand.  
- **Service Worker Support**: Enhances performance.  

---

## **11. What is the difference between `ng build` and `ng serve`?**  
| Command  | Purpose  |
|----------|-----------|
| `ng serve` | Runs the app in **development mode** with live reloading. |
| `ng build` | Compiles and **generates deployable files**. |

`ng serve` does not generate output files, while `ng build` does.  

---

## **12. What is the purpose of the `--prod` flag in `ng build`?**  
The `--prod` flag enables **production optimizations**, including:  
- **AOT Compilation**.  
- **Tree Shaking**.  
- **Minification & Uglification**.  
- **Stripping debug information**.  

Example:  
```sh
ng build --prod
```

---

## **13. What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation?**  
AOT compiles **Angular templates** during the **build phase**, instead of at runtime.  
Benefits:  
- Faster rendering.  
- Smaller bundle size.  
- Early error detection.  

Enable AOT manually:  
```sh
ng build --aot
```

---

## **14. How does Angular handle Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation?**  
JIT compiles templates **at runtime** in the browser, which:  
- Is **useful in development**.  
- Slows down **initial loading**.  

JIT is **default in `ng serve`**, while AOT is **default in production builds**.

---

## **15. What is tree shaking in Angular?**  
Tree shaking removes **unused JavaScript code** from the final bundle, reducing its size.  
- Enabled **automatically** in production builds.  
- Uses **ES6 module imports** for static analysis.  

Example:  
```ts
import { usedFunction } from 'utils'; // Unused functions get removed.
```

---

## **16. How does Angular CLI manage dependencies?**  
Angular CLI uses `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to manage dependencies.  
- Install dependencies:  
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
- Add a package:  
  ```sh
  ng add @angular/material
  ```
- Remove a package:  
  ```sh
  npm uninstall package-name
  ```

---

## **17. How do you upgrade an Angular project using CLI?**  
Run:  
```sh
ng update @angular/core @angular/cli
```
To check available updates:  
```sh
ng update
```
For major updates, follow [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/).

---

## **18. What is the purpose of the `ng update` command?**  
The `ng update` command:  
- Updates Angular packages (`@angular/core`, `@angular/cli`).  
- Fixes breaking changes automatically.  

Example:  
```sh
ng update @angular/material
```

---

## **19. How do you generate a service using Angular CLI?**  
Run:  
```sh
ng generate service my-service
```
This creates:  
```
src/app/my-service.service.ts
```
To use the service:  
```ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class MyService { }
```

---

## **20. What is Webpack, and how does Angular CLI use it?**  
Webpack is a **module bundler** that:  
- **Compiles and bundles** JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and assets.  
- Performs **tree shaking** and **code splitting**.  
- Optimizes **production builds**.  

Angular CLI **internally** uses Webpack but hides its complexity from developers.

### **Conclusion**  
Angular CLI is a **powerful tool** that automates project setup, development, and optimization. It simplifies common tasks like component generation, build optimization, and dependency management, making Angular development more efficient.
