## **1. What is a Single Page Application (SPA) in Angular?**  
A **Single Page Application (SPA)** is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates content as the user interacts with the app, without refreshing the entire page. In Angular, SPAs are achieved by handling routing in the client-side, allowing for a smoother, faster user experience.

## **2. How does Angular handle routing?**  
Angular handles routing using the **Angular Router**, which is a module that provides navigation between views or components based on the URL. It enables routing to different components based on the application state, while only loading the necessary components and views.

---

## **3. What is the Angular Router module?**  
The **Angular Router module** (`@angular/router`) is responsible for managing navigation between views or components in a single-page application. It allows for configuring routes, navigating between them, and passing parameters. This module enables the dynamic loading of components based on the route.

To use routing, you need to import the **RouterModule** in the app module:
```ts
import { RouterModule } from '@angular/router';
```

---

## **4. How do you configure routes in Angular?**  
To configure routes in Angular, you need to use the `RouterModule.forRoot()` method in the root module (typically `app.module.ts`). This method takes an array of route definitions, which map URL paths to components.

Example:
```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

## **5. What is a router-outlet?**  
A **router-outlet** is a directive used to mark where the routed component should be displayed in the template. It acts as a placeholder for views that will be dynamically inserted based on the current route.

Example:
```html
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
```
The content of the active route will be rendered within this tag.

---

## **6. How do you navigate between routes in Angular?**  
To navigate between routes in Angular, you can use the **routerLink** directive in the template or navigate programmatically using the **Router** service.

Template:
```html
<a [routerLink]="['/home']">Go to Home</a>
```

Programmatically:
```ts
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private router: Router) {}

navigateToHome() {
  this.router.navigate(['/home']);
}
```

---

## **7. What is ActivatedRoute in Angular?**  
The **ActivatedRoute** is a service that provides information about the current route, including parameters, query parameters, and the path of the route. It allows access to route-specific data in the component.

Example:
```ts
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.route.params.subscribe(params => {
    console.log(params['id']);
  });
}
```

---

## **8. How do you pass parameters in routing?**  
Route parameters are passed through the URL by defining a path with a placeholder (e.g., `:id`).

Example:
```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'profile/:id', component: ProfileComponent }
];
```
You can then navigate with parameters:
```ts
this.router.navigate(['/profile', userId]);
```

---

## **9. How do you retrieve route parameters?**  
Route parameters are retrieved using the **ActivatedRoute** service in the component.

Example:
```ts
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.route.paramMap.subscribe(params => {
    const id = params.get('id');
    console.log(id);
  });
}
```

---

## **10. What is lazy loading in Angular routing?**  
**Lazy loading** is a technique in Angular that allows you to load modules only when they are required, instead of loading all modules upfront. This improves the initial load time of the application.

You can configure lazy loading by using the `loadChildren` property in routes:
```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'feature',
    loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule)
  }
];
```

---

## **11. What are route guards in Angular?**  
**Route guards** are services that can prevent or allow navigation to a route based on certain conditions. There are several types of route guards:
- **canActivate**: Determines if a route can be activated.
- **canActivateChild**: Determines if child routes can be activated.
- **canDeactivate**: Prevents navigating away from the current route.
- **resolve**: Resolves data before activating the route.

---

## **12. How do you implement a route guard?**  
To implement a route guard, you need to create a service that implements one of the `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, etc., interfaces.

Example (`CanActivate` guard):
```ts
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { CanActivate, ActivatedRouteSnapshot, RouterStateSnapshot } from '@angular/router';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  canActivate(
    next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
    return isLoggedIn();  // Replace with actual logic
  }
}
```

Then, apply the guard in routes:
```ts
{ path: 'protected', component: ProtectedComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] }
```

---

## **13. What is canActivate in Angular?**  
**`canActivate`** is a route guard that determines if a route can be activated. It is useful for checking authentication or authorization before allowing navigation to a route.

Example:
```ts
canActivate(
  next: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
  state: RouterStateSnapshot): boolean {
    return this.authService.isLoggedIn();
}
```

---

## **14. What is canDeactivate in Angular?**  
**`canDeactivate`** is a route guard that prevents users from navigating away from a route if certain conditions are not met. It is useful for confirming unsaved changes or form data.

Example:
```ts
canDeactivate(
  component: CanComponentDeactivate
): Observable<boolean> | Promise<boolean> | boolean {
    return component.canDeactivate ? component.canDeactivate() : true;
}
```

---

## **15. What is preloading in Angular routing?**  
**Preloading** is a strategy that allows loading some modules in the background after the application is initially loaded. This can be done using the **PreloadAllModules** strategy, which loads all lazy-loaded modules after the initial app load.

Example:
```ts
@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules })]
})
```

---

## **16. What are child routes in Angular?**  
**Child routes** are nested routes defined within a parent route. They allow for a nested view hierarchy and enable modular application structures.

Example:
```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'parent',
    component: ParentComponent,
    children: [
      { path: 'child', component: ChildComponent }
    ]
  }
];
```

---

## **17. How do you handle wildcard routes in Angular?**  
**Wildcard routes** handle undefined paths (e.g., 404 errors) in Angular. They are usually defined as the last route with a path of `**`.

Example:
```ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent }
];
```

---

## **18. What is routerLinkActive in Angular?**  
**`routerLinkActive`** is a directive used to add or remove CSS classes when a route is active. It helps in highlighting the active link in navigation menus.

Example:
```html
<a [routerLink]="'/home'" routerLinkActive="active">Home</a>
```
When the `/home` route is active, the `active` class is applied.

---

## **19. How do you handle query parameters in Angular?**  
Query parameters are handled using the **ActivatedRoute** service to access the `queryParams`.

Example:
```ts
import { ActivatedRoute } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.route.queryParams.subscribe(params => {
    console.log(params['search']);
  });
}
```

---

## **20. How do you navigate programmatically in Angular?**  
To navigate programmatically, inject the **Router** service and use its `navigate()` method.

Example:
```ts
import { Router } from '@angular/router';

constructor(private router: Router) {}

navigateToAbout() {
  this.router.navigate(['/about']);
}
```
