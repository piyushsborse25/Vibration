### **TypeScript & Essential Files**  

#### **1. What is TypeScript, and how is it used in Angular?**  
TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** developed by Microsoft that adds **static typing, interfaces, and advanced features** to JavaScript. In Angular, TypeScript is the preferred language because:  
- It provides **strong typing** for better code quality and maintainability.  
- It supports **OOP concepts** like classes, interfaces, and inheritance.  
- It enables **decorators**, which are essential for defining Angular components, services, and modules.  
- It has **better tooling and error checking**, which improves development efficiency.  

#### **2. How is TypeScript different from JavaScript?**  
| Feature         | TypeScript  | JavaScript  |  
|---------------|-------------|-------------|  
| **Typing**   | Static (Explicit types) | Dynamic (Implicit types) |  
| **Compilation** | Compiles to JavaScript | Interpreted directly by browsers |  
| **Interfaces** | Supports interfaces | No interface support |  
| **OOP Features** | Full class-based OOP | Prototypes-based OOP |  
| **Modules** | Uses ES modules & namespaces | Uses ES6+ modules |  
| **Error Handling** | Detects errors at compile-time | Errors occur at runtime |  

#### **3. What are the advantages of using TypeScript?**  
- **Static Typing** – Reduces runtime errors.  
- **Code Readability & Maintainability** – Improves collaboration in large projects.  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Support** – Uses classes, interfaces, and inheritance.  
- **IntelliSense & IDE Support** – Provides better auto-completion and debugging.  
- **ES6+ Features** – Works with modern JavaScript features.  

#### **4. What is transpilation in TypeScript?**  
Transpilation is the process of converting **TypeScript code (.ts)** into **JavaScript (.js)** because browsers do not understand TypeScript directly. The **TypeScript compiler (tsc)** is responsible for this process.  

#### **5. What are the different data types in TypeScript?**  
- **Primitive Types**: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`.  
- **Object Types**: `Array`, `Tuple`, `Enum`, `Class`, `Interface`.  
- **Any Type**: `any` (disables type checking).  
- **Unknown Type**: `unknown` (safer alternative to `any`).  
- **Void Type**: `void` (used for functions that do not return a value).  
- **Never Type**: `never` (used for functions that never return).  

#### **6. What are interfaces in TypeScript?**  
Interfaces define the **structure of an object** in TypeScript without specifying implementation.  
```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
let user: Person = { name: "John", age: 30 };
```
They ensure **consistency** across objects and classes.  

#### **7. How do decorators work in TypeScript?**  
Decorators are **special functions** that modify classes, methods, or properties. They are commonly used in Angular for defining components and services.  
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html'
})
class ExampleComponent {}
```
Here, `@Component` is a decorator that **transforms** the `ExampleComponent` class into an Angular component.  

#### **8. What is a class in TypeScript?**  
A class is a **blueprint** for creating objects. It supports OOP features like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.  
```typescript
class Person {
  constructor(public name: string, public age: number) {}
  greet() { console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`); }
}
```

#### **9. What are modules in TypeScript?**  
Modules allow **code organization** by grouping related functionalities into separate files.  
```typescript
export class User { name: string; }
import { User } from './user';
```
Angular uses **modules** to structure applications efficiently.

### **Essential Angular Files**  

#### **10. What is `package.json`, and why is it important in Angular?**  
The `package.json` file:  
- Contains project dependencies (`dependencies`, `devDependencies`).  
- Defines project scripts (`scripts`).  
- Stores metadata like the project name and version.  

#### **11. What is `tsconfig.json`, and what is its role?**  
It is the **TypeScript configuration file** that defines compiler options.  
- `"target": "ES6"` – Specifies ECMAScript version.  
- `"module": "CommonJS"` – Defines module format.  
- `"strict": true` – Enables strict type checking.  

#### **12. What is the role of the `angular.json` file?**  
It is the **configuration file** for Angular CLI, specifying:  
- Project settings (`defaultProject`, `sourceRoot`).  
- Build configurations (`assets`, `styles`, `scripts`).  
- Development & production settings.  

#### **13. What is the `polyfills.ts` file in Angular?**  
The `polyfills.ts` file **enables backward compatibility** with older browsers by including missing JavaScript features like `Promise`, `Fetch API`, etc.  

#### **14. What is the purpose of the `environment.ts` file?**  
This file **stores environment-specific settings** like API endpoints.  
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:3000'
};
```
Angular replaces it with `environment.prod.ts` in production builds.  

#### **15. What is the `node_modules` folder in Angular?**  
This folder contains all **third-party dependencies** installed via `npm install`. It includes Angular libraries, TypeScript, RxJS, etc.

### **TypeScript in Angular Development**  

#### **16. How does TypeScript improve Angular development?**  
- **Type Safety** – Reduces runtime errors.  
- **Better Tooling** – IDEs provide auto-completion and debugging.  
- **OOP Support** – Uses classes, interfaces, and inheritance.  
- **Decorator Support** – Required for Angular features like `@Component`, `@Injectable`.  

#### **17. What is a strongly-typed language?**  
A strongly-typed language **enforces type constraints** at compile-time.  
```typescript
let count: number = "Hello"; // Error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
```
This prevents unintended type errors.  

#### **18. How does TypeScript support object-oriented programming?**  
TypeScript supports **OOP concepts** like:  
- **Classes & Objects**  
- **Encapsulation** (private, public, protected access modifiers)  
- **Inheritance** (extends)  
- **Polymorphism** (method overriding)  
- **Interfaces & Abstract Classes**  

#### **19. What is an observable in TypeScript?**  
Observables are part of **RxJS** and enable **reactive programming**. They handle **asynchronous data streams** and support operators like `map`, `filter`, `subscribe`.  
```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
const obs = new Observable(subscriber => {
  subscriber.next('Hello');
  subscriber.complete();
});
obs.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
```
Angular uses **Observables** in HTTP requests and event handling.  

#### **20. What is a promise in TypeScript?**  
A **promise** represents a **future value** of an asynchronous operation.  
```typescript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => resolve('Data loaded'), 2000);
});
promise.then(data => console.log(data));
```
Promises handle **one-time** async events, whereas **Observables** handle **streams** of data.
