### **1. What is Angular, and why is it used?**  
Angular is a TypeScript-based front-end framework developed by Google for building dynamic, scalable, and single-page web applications (SPAs). It provides a structured approach to developing web applications by integrating features like dependency injection, component-based architecture, and two-way data binding.

It is used for:  
- Developing robust, maintainable, and scalable web applications.  
- Creating SPAs where the user experience is seamless without reloading the page.  
- Enhancing productivity with built-in features like templates, forms handling, and reactive programming.

### **2. What are the key features of Angular?**  
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Applications are built using modular, reusable components.  
- **Two-Way Data Binding:** Synchronizes data between the model and the view automatically.  
- **Dependency Injection (DI):** Manages dependencies efficiently for better modularity and testability.  
- **Directives:** Extend HTML functionality with custom behavior.  
- **Routing:** Enables navigation between views without reloading the page.  
- **Observables & RxJS:** Supports reactive programming for handling asynchronous operations.  
- **Modularization:** Uses NgModules to organize application logic.  
- **Lazy Loading:** Loads modules only when needed, improving performance.  
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation:** Converts TypeScript into optimized JavaScript before the browser executes it.

| Feature            | Angular                 | React                     | Vue.js                      |
|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Language**      | TypeScript (superset of JavaScript) | JavaScript (JSX)         | JavaScript (or TypeScript) |
| **Architecture**  | Component-based MVC | Component-based (Virtual DOM) | Component-based (Virtual DOM) |
| **Data Binding**  | Two-way data binding | One-way (default)         | Two-way data binding        |
| **Dependency Injection** | Built-in | External libraries required | Limited DI support         |
| **Performance**   | Optimized with AOT, Ivy | Fast due to Virtual DOM  | Fast with Virtual DOM      |
| **State Management** | Services & RxJS | Redux, Context API        | Vuex                        |

### **4. Explain the evolution of Angular from AngularJS to Angular.**  
- **AngularJS (2010 - v1.x)**:  
  - Based on JavaScript, used MVC pattern.  
  - Two-way binding but had performance issues with large applications.  
- **Angular 2 (2016 - Complete Rewrite)**:  
  - TypeScript-based, modular architecture.  
  - Improved performance with hierarchical dependency injection.  
- **Angular 4 & 5:**  
  - Faster rendering, smaller bundle sizes, and AOT improvements.  
- **Angular 6 - 8:**  
  - Added Ivy renderer, CLI improvements, and better lazy loading.  
- **Angular 9 - 12:**  
  - Default Ivy engine, improved performance, and strict type checking.  
- **Angular 13+:**  
  - Removed support for legacy View Engine, modernized package format, improved error handling, and optimized component rendering.

### **5. What are the advantages of using Angular?**  
✔ **Component-based architecture** - Reusability & maintainability.  
✔ **TypeScript support** - Type safety & improved tooling.  
✔ **Built-in features** - Routing, forms, HTTP client, testing utilities.  
✔ **High performance** - Thanks to AOT compilation & Ivy engine.  
✔ **Strong community support** - Backed by Google with long-term support.

### **6. What is the difference between Angular and React?**  
| Feature        | Angular                      | React                       |
|--------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Architecture** | Framework with MVC         | Library focusing on UI   |
| **Language**  | TypeScript                  | JavaScript with JSX      |
| **DOM**       | Real DOM                     | Virtual DOM             |
| **Data Binding** | Two-way                     | One-way                 |
| **Performance** | AOT & Ivy optimization      | Lightweight, Virtual DOM  |
| **State Management** | Services & RxJS           | Redux, Context API       |

### **7. What are the building blocks of an Angular application?**  
- **Modules** (NgModule) - Organizes code into logical units.  
- **Components** - UI elements with logic, HTML, and CSS.  
- **Templates** - Defines the HTML structure of components.  
- **Directives** - Extend HTML with additional behavior.  
- **Services & Dependency Injection** - Share logic across components.  
- **Routing** - Manages navigation between views.  

---

### **8. What is a component in Angular?**  
A **component** is a UI element in Angular. It consists of:  
- **HTML Template** (UI structure)  
- **TypeScript Class** (Logic and data)  
- **CSS/SCSS** (Styling)  

Example:
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  templateUrl: './example.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./example.component.css']
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  title = 'Hello Angular';
}
```

---

### **9. What is a module in Angular?**  
A **module** (NgModule) is a container for related components, directives, services, and pipes.  
Example:  
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

---

### **10. What is a template in Angular?**  
A **template** defines the component's UI using HTML and Angular bindings.  
Example:
```html
<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<button (click)="changeTitle()">Click Me</button>
```

---

### **11. What is a view in Angular?**  
A **view** is a rendered portion of the UI managed by Angular.

---

### **12. What are pipes in Angular?**  
Pipes transform displayed data in templates.  
Example:
```html
<p>{{ today | date:'short' }}</p>
```

---

### **13. What are Angular lifecycle hooks?**  
Lifecycle hooks manage component state at different stages.  
- **ngOnInit()** – Runs after component initialization.  
- **ngOnDestroy()** – Cleanup before component removal.  
- **ngOnChanges()** – Detects changes in inputs.  

---

### **14. Explain the concept of change detection in Angular.**  
Angular updates the UI when component data changes using **Zone.js** and **change detection strategies**.

---

### **15. What is a directive in Angular?**  
Directives modify the behavior of DOM elements.  
Example:
```html
<p *ngIf="isVisible">This is a directive example</p>
```

---

### **16. What is the purpose of zones in Angular?**  
Zones detect asynchronous operations (like HTTP requests) and trigger change detection.

---

### **17. Explain the concept of event binding in Angular.**  
Event binding listens to user interactions like clicks.  
Example:
```html
<button (click)="onClick()">Click Me</button>
```

---

### **18. What is one-way data binding in Angular?**  
One-way binding allows data to flow in a **single direction** (from model to view).  
Example:
```html
<p>{{ message }}</p>
```

---

### **19. What are some key disadvantages of Angular?**  
- **Steep learning curve** due to TypeScript and complex features.  
- **Performance overhead** from real DOM and dependency injection.  
- **Large bundle size** compared to React.  

---

### **20. Explain the working of the Angular application execution cycle.**  
1. **Bootstrap phase** – Loads main module (`AppModule`).  
2. **Compilation** – Converts TypeScript to JavaScript.  
3. **Rendering** – Updates UI using the DOM.  
4. **Change Detection** – Monitors data changes and updates the view.  
5. **Destruction** – Cleans up when components are removed.
